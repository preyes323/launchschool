### General Requirements

Build a todo app using the following [HTML and CSS](http://d3905n0khyu9wc.cloudfront.net/todo_app/todo_app.zip) as starting point*. The todo app will use the MVC framework that was built earlier in the course.

Here's a link to the course page for the [complete requirements document](https://launchschool.com/lessons/fae4fa27/assignments/4953c85b).

**I'll use precompiled Handlebards templates instead of creating during runtime. I won't be using jQuery also.*

### Specific Requirements

* Typing in a todo and submitting the form creates a new todo item
* Clicking the check box for a todo toggles its completed state
* Clicking the text for the todo toggles editing for that todo
* Clicking outside of the text input for a currently editing todo saves the edit
* Clicking clear complete will find all completed todos and remove them
